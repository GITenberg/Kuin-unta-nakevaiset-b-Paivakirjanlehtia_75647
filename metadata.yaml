summary: '"Kuin unta näkeväiset... : Päiväkirjanlehtiä" by Helene Christaller is a
  collection of diary entries written in the early 20th century. The work explores
  the thoughts and feelings of the main character, a sick man grappling with his existential
  despair while residing in a sanatorium amidst the natural beauty of the Schwarzwald.
  The narrative delves into themes of illness, isolation, and the longing for connection.  The
  opening portion presents the protagonist reflecting on his deteriorating health
  and the sorrow that accompanies his diagnosis of tuberculosis. He describes a recent
  encounter with his doctor, who advised him to seek a quiet place, revealing the
  man''s sense of impending doom and his internal struggle with despair. The diary
  sketches a vivid portrait of his surroundings and a deep yearning for love and meaning
  in a life overshadowed by illness. As he interacts with the few people in his life,
  including a devoted innkeeper and a young teacher, he wrestles with feelings of
  bitterness and self-reflection, setting the stage for a poignant exploration of
  the human condition. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
